This file contains three folders, one is Rock Slope Case, which is the data set B in the article, the other is the actual project in the article, and the last one is an example of code implementation, including the cube and tetrahedron in the data set a in the article, as well as the implementation code.

All the folders contain code input related files (data_density、data_distance、data_normals、data_resample and data_triangle), and output related folders (Face and Occurrence). All the files are imported and exported as .txt files.
